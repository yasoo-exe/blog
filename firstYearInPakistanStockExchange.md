## Introduction
Upon departing my call center role in November 2022 to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science and a career as a web developer, I found myself with surplus funds earmarked for a two-year horizon. Having previously invested in Bitcoin post-crash, I strategically directed the remaining capital into the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). This article chronicles my investment journey and highlights key insights.

## Research and Preparation
My exploration of the PSX was thorough, spanning diverse platforms such as Google, YouTube, and Twitter. I delved into articles, videos, podcasts, and Twitter spaces featuring finance, investment, and economy professionals, harnessing tools like sarmaaya.pk for informed decision-making.

## First Investment and Year-End Review
Embarking on my maiden investment on 17-01-2023, nearly a year has transpired. Let's delve into the performance metrics.

### Overall Performance
2023 emerged as a blockbuster year for the PSX, delivering a remarkable ~55% return. Despite a gloomy first half marked by distressing news of potential defaults and import bans, I strategically entered the market, achieving an impressive XX% yearly return, surpassing the annual inflation rate.

### Individual Stocks Performance

#### Lucky Cement ($LUCK) - XX%
Timing a purchase aligned with a massive share buyback announcement, Lucky Cement yielded an impressive XX% gain within a year. Renowned as the largest cement player in Pakistan, its diversified ventures and strategic positioning fueled my confidence.

#### Meezan Bank ($MEBL) - XX%
Amid the digital revolution, Meezan Bank led the banking sector's upward trajectory, reflected in record profits for 2023, exceeding Rs 86 billion, a 91% YoY increase. As a stalwart in my portfolio, Meezan Bank's consistent performance reaffirms a long-term investment strategy.

#### Indus Motor Company ($INDU) - XX%
Strategically acquiring shares during a temporary production halt due to external factors, Indus Motor Company showcased resilience with a XX% increase in my investment. Despite lower dividends, the company's historical track record signals a potential rebound.

#### Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum Limited ($OGDC and $PPL) - XX%
Hyped throughout 2023, these stocks rode the wave of speculation surrounding potential government intervention to clear circular debt. While the anticipated resolution did not materialize, my calculated investment strategy has yielded returns. Current holdings, constituting less than 5% of my portfolio, remain steadfast despite recent fluctuations.

#### Systems Limited - ($SYS)
Despite disappointment in 2023, Systems Limited endures in my portfolio. Attributing the decline in earnings to delayed repatriation amid PKR devaluation, optimism prevails regarding a rebound upon their return to Pakistan.

## Conclusion
Reflecting on an extraordinary market year in 2023, unmatched in the past decade, the PSX's potential shines brightly. Anticipating further brilliance with political and economic stabilization, companies continue to present lucrative opportunities at attractively low prices. The adage holds true: the best time to invest was yesterday, but the second-best time is now.

Eagerly eyeing a future of wealth creation, preservation, and expansion, recent additions to my portfolio signal optimism for what lies ahead.
